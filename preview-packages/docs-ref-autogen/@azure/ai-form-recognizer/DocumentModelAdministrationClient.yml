package: '@azure/ai-form-recognizer'
summary: >
  A client for interacting with the Form Recognizer service's model management
  features, such as creating, reading,

  listing, deleting, and copying models.

  ### Examples:


  #### Azure Active Directory


  ```typescript

  import { DocumentModelAdministrationClient } from "@azure/ai-form-recognizer";

  import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";


  const endpoint = "https://<resource name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com";

  const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();


  const client = new DocumentModelAdministrationClient(endpoint, credential);

  ```


  #### API Key (Subscription Key)


  ```typescript

  import { DocumentModelAdministrationClient, AzureKeyCredential } from
  "@azure/ai-form-recognizer";


  const endpoint = "https://<resource name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com";

  const credential = new AzureKeyCredential("<api key>");


  const client = new DocumentModelAdministrationClient(endpoint, credential);

    package: '@azure/ai-form-recognizer'
    summary: >
      Build a new model with a given ID from a set of input documents and
      labeled fields.

      The Model ID can consist of any text, so long as it does not begin with
      "prebuilt-" (as these models refer to

      prebuilt Form Recognizer models that are common to all resources), and so
      long as it does not already exist within

      the resource.


      The Form Recognizer service reads the training data set from an Azure
      Storage container, given as a URL to the

      container with a SAS token that allows the service backend to communicate
      with the container. At a minimum, the

      "read" and "list" permissions are required. In addition, the data in the
      given container must be organized

      according to a particular convention, which is documented in [the
      service's documentation for building custom

      models](https://aka.ms/form-recognizer/custom).


      ### Example


      ```javascript

      const modelId = "aNewModel";

      const containerUrl = "<training data container SAS URL>";


      const poller = await client.beginBuildModel(modelId, containerUrl, {
        // Optionally, a text description may be attached to the model
        description: "This is an example model!"
      });


      // Model building, like all other model creation operations, returns a
      poller that eventually produces a ModelDetails

      // object

      const modelDetails = await poller.pollUntilDone();


      const {
        modelId, // identical to the modelId given when creating the model
        description, // identical to the description given when creating the model
        createdDateTime, // the Date (timestamp) that the model was created
        docTypes // information about the document types in the model and their field schemas
      } = modelDetails;

      ### **Breaking Change**


      In previous versions of the Form Recognizer REST API and SDK, the
      `getModel` method could return any model, even

      one that failed to create due to errors. In the new service versions,
      `getModel` and `listModels` _only produce

      successfully created models_ (i.e. models that are "ready" for use).
      Failed models are now retrieved through the

      "operations" APIs, see
      <xref:@azure/ai-form-recognizer.DocumentModelAdministrationClient.getOperation>
      and
      <xref:@azure/ai-form-recognizer.DocumentModelAdministrationClient.listOperations>.

            description,
            // the schema of the fields in this document type, see the FieldSchema type
            fieldSchema,

      List model creation operations in the resource. This will produce all
      operations, including operations that failed

      to create models successfully. This operation supports paging.

      ### Examples


      #### Async Iteration


      ```javascript

      for await (const operation of client.listOperations()) {
        const {
          operationId, // the operation's GUID
          status, // the operation status, one of "notStarted", "running", "succeeded", "failed", or "canceled"
          percentCompleted // the progress of the operation, from 0 to 100
        } = operation;
      }

      ```


      #### By Page


      ```javascript

      // The listOperations method is paged, and you can iterate by page using
      the `byPage` method.

      const pages = client.listOperations().byPage();


      for await (const page of pages) {
        // Each page is an array of operation info objects and can be iterated synchronously
        for (const operation of page) {
          const {
            operationId, // the operation's GUID
            status, // the operation status, one of "notStarted", "running", "succeeded", "failed", or "canceled"
            percentCompleted // the progress of the operation, from 0 to 100
          } = operation;
        }
      }

      ```

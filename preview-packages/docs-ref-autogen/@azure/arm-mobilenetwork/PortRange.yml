  Range of port numbers to use as translated ports on each translated address.

  If not specified and NAPT is enabled, this range defaults to 1,024 - 49,999.

  (Ports under 1,024 should not be used because these are special purpose ports
  reserved by IANA. Ports 50,000 and above are reserved for non-NAPT use.)

      `True` returns usage data in instance-level detail, `false` causes
      server-side aggregation with fewer details. For example, if you have 3
      website instances, by default you will get 3 line items for website
      consumption. If you specify showDetails = false, the data will be
      aggregated as a single line item for website consumption within the time
      period (for the given subscriptionId, meterId, usageStartTime and
      usageEndTime).
